"""Invariance / equivariance checks for the tagging models.

Inspired by the L-GATr equivariance helper
(https://github.com/heidelberg-hepml/lorentz-gatr/blob/main/tests/helpers/equivariance.py),
adapted to this repo: the tagging models output a classification score, which
must be **invariant** under the (residual) symmetry group. These helpers
transform the input four-momenta by random group elements and assert that the
score is unchanged within tolerance, over several random draws (``num_checks``).

The available transforms come from ``lloca.utils.rand_transforms``:
    xyrotation  -- azimuthal SO(2) about the beam (preserved by every tagging
                   setup, including those with beam/time spurions),
    rotation    -- SO(3),
    boost       -- a Lorentz boost,
    lorentz     -- the full SO(1,3).
