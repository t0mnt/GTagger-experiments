# TODO — outstanding work

A running checklist for finishing the graph-transformer hybrid study and connecting it to
a paper. Grouped by "before training", "open design decisions", and "paper release".

---

## 1. Before training — fill in the training configs

The 8 hybrid recipes are skeletons with required `???` keys:
`config/training/top_{Plain,ParticleNetParT,CGENNLGATr,LorentzNetLGATrSlim}{GraphTrans,GraphGPS}.yaml`.

The 8 GT recipes now inherit `tag_gts_and_friends_default` (shared `epochs=20` + `scheduler=CosineAnnealingWarmup`);
only **`batchsize`, `lr`** remain `???` per model (optionally `weight_decay`):

- [ ] `batchsize` ← `find_lr.py +lr_find.find_batch_size=true` (largest power-of-two that fits the H100).
- [ ] `lr` ← `find_lr.py` (reported loss-min / 10).
- [ ] `weight_decay` ← tune on val ∈ {0, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1} for AdamW (ParT-style 0.01 is a fine start).
- [x] `epochs` (shared data-exposure budget) and `scheduler` are **decided** in `tag_gts_and_friends_default`
      (see §2); `iterations` is auto-derived at runtime (`_resolve_epoch_budget`).

## 2. Training-recipe decisions (fairness)

**Scheduler — DECIDED: `CosineAnnealingWarmup`** (set in `tag_gts_and_friends_default`), shared across the GT
hybrids, tuning only lr/batchsize/weight_decay per model — warmup matters for the transformer/
equivariant layers, and one shared schedule isolates architecture for the hybrid-vs-hybrid table.
`OneCycleLR` is the repo-proven alternative (it is warmup→cosine too) but its warmup is cosine-shaped
and it cycles AdamW's β₁ by default — minor confounds. The published **baselines** (ParT/ParticleNet/
L-GATr) keep their own recipes as reference rows (you can't out-tune the originals); optionally re-run
them under the shared schedule for one apples-to-apples row. Annealing to ~0 is desirable (the
end-of-training low-lr phase gives the best final val metric); per-module heterogeneity is handled by
warmup (peak) + AdamW + `lr_factor_framesnet`, not by raising the floor. Set a small
`cosanneal_eta_min` (e.g. 1e-6) only as a hedge against a slightly over-long schedule.

**Epochs vs iterations.** Now automated: set `training.epochs` and `iterations` is derived per model as
`epochs * len(train_loader)` (the exact batch count — reflects batchsize, subsampling, drop_last). This
equalizes **data exposure** (the standard fairness axis); note equal epochs ≠ equal gradient *updates*
(a larger-batch model gets fewer steps), and each model still anneals fully over its own iteration count.
- [x] Epoch budget **decided: `epochs=20`** (ParT-standard) in `tag_gts_and_friends_default`, shared by all 8 GT
      hybrids; bump to ~30 if they underfit (CLI: `training.epochs=30`).
- [ ] Keep the baselines' published-recipe numbers as a separate reference row in the table.

**Best-checkpoint metric.** `best_model_metric` (in `tag_default`): `loss` (default, lowest val loss) or
`accuracy` (highest val accuracy). Selection-by-loss and -by-accuracy usually track but can diverge late;
the toggle only changes which checkpoint `es_load_best_model` keeps/reports.

## 3. Ablations — CLI recipes (for the paper's ablation tables)

All via Hydra overrides on `run.py` (use `-cp config` for the full configs). Every override is
recorded per-run in `config.yaml` + the flattened MLflow params, so any sweep is reconstructable
from the run dir. **Surfaced in the results table** (`aggregate_table.py` `COLUMNS`): only `frames`
(framesnet) and `kNN` (`knn_metric`); everything else (knn_k, num_layers/num_blocks, bias,
pair_input_dim, use_rwse, use_edge_attr, …) lives only in config.yaml / MLflow. To put a knob in the
head-to-head table, add it to `aggregate_table.py`'s `COLUMNS` string **and** the per-run `table …:`
log line that the regex reads.

- **kNN graph (all networks).** count `model.net.knn_k=K` (CGENN uses `model.net.k=K`); metric
  `model.net.knn_metric=deltaR|minkowski`; fully-connected = k ≥ P−1 (`9999`, or `model.net.k=null`
  for CGENN). minkowski is the Lorentz-invariant graph (needed for full-group invariance); deltaR is
  the eta–phi graph.
- **LLoCa on/off (the non-equivariant backbones: Plain, ParticleNet-ParT).** on =
  `model/framesnet=learnedso13` (learned SO(1,3) frames → tensorial transport engaged); off / "do
  nothing" = `model/framesnet=identity` (no-op, bit-identical plain backbone). Symmetry-budget
  variants: `learnedso3` (rotations), `learnedso2`, `learnedz`, `learnedrest`, `learnedpd`;
  `randomlorentz` is the data-augmentation baseline. (CGENN / LorentzNet are already internally
  equivariant → leave on `identity`.)
- **ParT pairwise bias (ParticleNet-ParT GraphTrans + GraphGPS).** `model.net.bias=true|false`;
  `model.net.pair_input_dim=1|4|5|7` selects how many QCD interaction features (1=lnΔ; 4=+ln kT,
  ln z, ln m²; 5=+lnΔs²; 7=+cosθ,Δy,Δφ — see `pairwise_lv_fts`). The learned weights compensate, so
  the bias stays compatible with the frame transport.
- **GraphGPS PE/SE (Plain GraphGPS).** relative edge PE `model.net.use_edge_attr=true|false`
  (Minkowski log|(pᵢ+pⱼ)²|); structural encoding `model.net.use_rwse=true|false`
  (+`model.net.rwse_k=K`); norm `model.net.norm=batch|layer`. CGENN GraphGPS relative edge features:
  `model.net.use_explicit_edge_features=true|false`.
- **Depth (transformer / GPS blocks).** `model.net.num_layers=N` (Plain, ParticleNet-ParT) /
  `model.net.num_blocks=N` (CGENN, LorentzNet). The depth curve is the "can the transformer
  compensate for a weaker GNN" story → a performance/efficiency section (room to discuss BigBird /
  sparse attention and the flex / xformers / flash backends the L-GATr stack already supports).

Other knobs worth a sweep: width/capacity (`hidden_*_channels`, `dim`, `gnn_dims`, `embed_dim`);
input-skip (`model.net.use_input_concat`); residual-symmetry spurions on the equivariant models
(`model.net.beam_spurion`, `model.net.add_time_spurion`); dropout. Depth and width move the param
count (a table column) — pair them with FLOPs/time for a fair efficiency plot.

**Omitted by design: global spectral PE/SE (LapPE / SignNet / eigenvalue SE).** Not implemented,
and the omission is deliberate — worth a sentence in the paper. (1) A jet has *no canonical graph*:
the kNN adjacency/Laplacian is something we construct (eta–phi or minkowski kNN, and rebuilt in
feature space for EdgeConv), so anything read off its spectrum encodes our graph-building choice, not
the physics. (2) A jet is *not position-blind*: particles carry (Δη, Δφ, pT, E) — a physically
meaningful absolute PE that LapPE would only try to reconstruct (this is exactly why ParT ships no
positional encoding). (3) Under LLoCa a PE must be a *Lorentz invariant* to preserve invariance, but
LapPE eigenvectors have sign/basis ambiguity **and** graph dependence, so they are not clean
invariants (SignNet exists only to patch the sign ambiguity). The encodings that transfer are the
relative QCD pairwise features (lnΔ, ln kT, ln z, ln m²) and, on a *static* graph, RWSE — both already
exposed above. If a reviewer wants the negative result demonstrated, a LapPE node-encoder behind a
`use_lappe` toggle on PlainGraphGPS is the cheapest way to show it doesn't help.

## 4. Open design decisions / discrepancies

- [x] **CGENN-LGATr GraphGPS local branch under-fed vs its GraphTrans cousin** — fixed in two
      passes: it now injects, under `use_explicit_edge_features` (default on), all three static
      signals the GraphTrans CGENN stage does — the relative-momentum edge multivectors
      `[pᵢ−pⱼ, rawᵢ, rawⱼ]`, **and** the raw mv / raw scalar inputs re-injected as per-node
      attributes (`node_attr_x` in `theta_x`, `node_attr_h` in `theta_h`) every layer. (The first
      pass added only the edge features; the node attributes were the missing two-thirds.)
      Equivariance 3/3 (xy-rotation + full-group rotation + Lorentz boost).
- [x] CLS readout frame: **jet frame** (covariant, boost into the jet rest frame). Decided.
- [x] LLoCa transport made **strictly additive** (identity frames bit-identical to the plain backbone).
- [x] Scheduler: shared **CosineAnnealingWarmup** available; **early termination off** (`es_patience=null`),
      best-validation checkpoint still reported.

### Audit findings (property-based sweep — permutation / mask / determinism / degenerate jets)
- [x] **BatchNorm-over-padding is FAITHFUL to official ParticleNet/ParT — verified, do NOT "fix".**
      The property test showed a real effect: in *training*, padding the same jet to more columns
      shifts the logits by up to 0.18 (ParticleNet-ParT GraphTrans), 0.08 (Plain GraphTrans), ~1e-3
      (the two GPS), because the input `bn_fts` (`nn.BatchNorm1d`, all 4 channels-first models) and the
      EdgeConv/MPNN `BatchNorm2d/1d` (Plain + ParticleNet GraphTrans) compute statistics over the
      zero-padded slots. **Checked against the references**: weaver ParticleNet does
      `self.bn_fts(features).masked_fill(padding_mask, 0)` (BN over the full padded tensor, mask
      *after*) with unmasked EdgeConv `BatchNorm2d`; weaver ParT's `Embed.input_bn` is a
      `nn.BatchNorm1d` over `(batch, channels, seq_len)` with no pre-mask (zeroed only after embed).
      Our ports reproduce both exactly, so this is intended fidelity, not a bug — masking it would
      DIVERGE from the architectures being compared. (The GraphGPS per-layer `MaskedNorm` is likewise
      faithful to the *GraphGPS* recipe's masked BatchNorm; each backbone matches its own lineage.)
      Eval is bit-exact (running stats). Nothing to change; documented for the paper's fidelity claim.
- [x] **Verified clean (all 8, float64):** determinism (bit-exact), permutation-invariance over
      particles (~1e-16), padded-VALUE leakage in eval (bit-exact), padding-COUNT invariance in eval
      (bit-exact), finite logits on degenerate 1-particle jets, **gradient coverage** (every trainable
      param reached by the loss), **batch-composition independence** (a jet's logits identical alone vs
      batched, ~1e-16 — no cross-jet leakage), and **identical-particle / collinear jets finite**.
      Set-symmetry, eval-time masking, batch isolation and numerics are sound across the family. (The
      `embed_tagging_data` in-place-`ptr` footgun found en route is documented at `embedding.py:103`.)
- [x] **Benign dead vector-path in `LorentzNetLGATrSlimGraphTrans`** (grad-coverage check). The
      `lgatr` LGATrSlim's `linear_out` multivector weights and the *last* block's MLP multivector
      weights get no gradient — they feed only the deliberately-discarded vector output
      (`out_v_channels=1`, "vector sink"; the model reads `_, s_out`). Intended, not a bug; a few wasted
      multivector params. (Earlier blocks' vector weights are live — vectors reach later scalars via
      attention. The GPS sibling routes differently and has none.)

### Audit findings (full GraphTrans-vs-GraphGPS sweep) — remaining, low priority
- [ ] **Local-branch dropout is inconsistent across the GraphGPS family.** Plain + CGENN GPS apply an
      external `Dropout` to the local-MPNN output (`Norm(Dropout(MPNN(X)) + X)`); LorentzNet + ParticleNet
      GPS apply **none** (their GNN owns an internal residual, so the layer adds only the external Norm).
      The residual difference is *deliberate* (avoids a double residual), but the dropout is dropped as a
      side effect. No-op at the default `dropout_prob=0`, so it only matters if dropout is enabled — decide
      whether the four local branches should match.

### Audit findings (infrastructure sweep: JetClass path / plots / trials)
- [x] **`jc_gts_and_friends_default` added** and `config/jctagging.yaml` now defaults to it (was
      `jc_ParT` — the same recipe-inheritance trap the top tree fixed). ParT-standard `epochs: 5`
      (1M steps x 512 = ~5 passes of 100M), CosineAnnealingWarmup, **wd 0** (JetClass convention,
      matches jc_ParT), validate once per nominal epoch.
- [x] **per-model `jc_<Hybrid>.yaml` recipes added (all 8)**, mirroring the `top_<Hybrid>` pattern
      (inherit `jc_gts_and_friends_default`; fill batchsize/lr from `find_lr.py -cn jctagging` —
      JetClass inputs are wider (7+10) so don't copy the top values). Also fixed `jc_lgatr`
      pointing at `tag_lgatr` (upstream's recipe name; this fork renamed those to `top_*`).
- [x] **the `???` batchsize/lr keys in the per-model recipes were silently inert**: OmegaConf
      MISSING never overrides a value inherited via the defaults chain, so `training=top_<hybrid>`
      with unfilled keys silently trained at tag_default's 512/1e-3 instead of erroring. All 16
      recipes (8 top + 8 jc) now carry explicit `UNSWEPT fallback` lines + comments, and
      GUIDE/OSCAR/SLURM no longer claim `???` enforces anything.
- [ ] **(opinion / optional guardrail)** code-vs-user split for seeds & recipes is right as-is
      (seed=null → every fresh trial is an independent init; explicit `training=` beats magic), but
      two cheap code-side guardrails would close the remaining footguns: (a) log a WARNING when a
      GT-hybrid recipe runs at exactly the UNSWEPT fallback (512, 1e-3) — likely a forgotten
      find_lr; (b) log a WARNING when `seed` is set AND `warm_start_load=false` — fixed seed makes
      "fresh trials" identical, defeating the mean±std table.
- [ ] **Rejection-metric convention differs between experiments** (pre-existing): top-tagging uses the
      nearest-ROC-point (`argmin |tpr - epsS|`), JetClass uses `scipy.interp1d` interpolation. One
      methods sentence, or unify.
- [x] **best-checkpoint restore now re-pairs the EMA**: the end of `train()` loads the checkpoint's
      `"ema"` alongside `"model"` (when `ema: true`), so the `_ema` eval uses the EMA shadow that
      belongs to the restored best-validation checkpoint instead of the end-of-training one.

### Pre-publication audit (session: jet_frames + GT-family sanity sweep)

Training-readiness verified across all 8 GT hybrids (real `config/`): forward + backward + AdamW step
crash-free; param counts 1.16–2.53M (LorentzNet 1.83/2.46M, CGENN GNN 248k — the earlier fixes held;
small later deltas: the audit's node_attr re-injection adds +1.5k/+6.7k to the LorentzNet hybrids and
the official-CGENN knob flip removes the NormalizationLayer params, so counts are now 1.15/1.90/1.83/2.46M
for CGENN-Trans/CGENN-GPS/LN-Trans/LN-GPS);
**zero dead input channels** in either the four-momentum path or the 7 `tagging_features` (the general
form of the CGENN `node_attr` check — CGENN comes back balanced). PDFrames runs end-to-end on the 4
non-equivariant hybrids (Plain × {Trans, GPS}, ParticleNet-ParT × {Trans, GPS}); the 4 internally-equivariant
hybrids (CGENN, LorentzNet) **assert `IdentityFrames`** by design (`self.framesnet = framesnet  # not actually
used`; `IdentityFrames` is 0-param and never referenced — a perfect no-op). The `/20` momentum rescale is
inherited from the standalone references (equivariant backbones rescale manually; non-equivariant ones
canonicalize via `TaggerWrapper` + BatchNorm). Equivariance 32/32 (both frames), `test_amplitudes` fixed,
training smoke (`PlainGraphTrans + learnedpd`) ran end-to-end through evaluation.

- [ ] **`torch.cuda.amp.autocast(...)` deprecation in 4 active baseline files** (plaingraphtrans.py:285,
      plaingraphgps.py:322, particlenetpartgraphgps.py:223, particlenettransformer.py:792; mipart.py
      has 2 more in commented-out code). `FutureWarning` today, error in some future torch. Mechanical
      migration to `torch.amp.autocast('cuda', ...)`; will not change current numerics.
- [ ] **ParT-GPS mixed-type attention mask deprecation** at particlenetpartgraphgps.py:115 — float
      `attn_mask=attn_bias` paired with bool `key_padding_mask` triggers torch's "mismatched
      key_padding_mask and attn_mask is deprecated" warning. Functionally correct today (padding still
      goes to −∞); future-fatal. Fix: merge the bool padding mask into the float bias (`bias.masked_fill(pad, -inf)`)
      and pass a single float `attn_mask`.
- [ ] **`xformers` env note for the SLURM target** — the installed wheel must match the cluster's
      torch+python or the L-GATr `lgatr` equivectors silently fall back / fail to load (this is the same
      class as the 9 environment-only FLOPs failures in this dev container). Pin a known-good
      (torch, xformers) pair in `docs/SLURM.md` under the install step; matters only for runs that
      actually use `lgatr` equivectors.
- [ ] **Precision-floor note for the paper** — `learnedpd` carries a higher boost-precision floor than
      `learnedso13` (float64, polar decomposition divides by energy). Measured at ~1e-4 absolute (kNN, 10
      boosts) on the GT hybrids — far below any true symmetry break and consistent with the standalone
      baselines (ParT ~1e-4, ParticleNet ~1e-7 same conditions). The test file already encodes per-frame
      tolerances; one sentence in the methods section would head off reviewer questions.

- [x] **jet_frames lloca-compat fix** — `TaggerWrapper.jet_frames` always uses the 4d orthogonalizer
      but reused the framesnet's `ortho_kwargs` (which the PD family keys as `eps_reg`, the 3d name).
      Translate the key for the 4d call so any framesnet works.
- [x] **jet_frames missing `num_graphs`** — set-level equivectors (`pelican`) need it; mirror the main
      framesnet path. `equimlp` absorbs it via `**kwargs`.
- [x] **`test_tag_equivariance.py::test_lloca_frame_invariance`** now parametrizes over both `learnedpd`
      and `learnedso13` (LLoCa's recommended default is PD; `so13` was the only frame tested before, which
      hid the jet_frames bug). Per-frame tolerances (`so13` ≤ 1e-3, `pd` ≤ 2e-2) — 16/16.
- [x] **`test_tag_invariance.py::test_amplitudes`** had a stale config key (`data.tagging_features_framesnet=null`,
      removed upstream by `f08f7df`/`a45da1b`) — every case failed at config composition before any model ran,
      so the baseline-under-frames check was silently dead. Aligned to `data.tagging_features=null`; 16/16.

- [ ] **LorentzNet GraphGPS never zeroes padded slots between its layers** (only at the final pool), so the
      shared `LorentzNetKNNBlock`'s BatchNorms accumulate over nonzero padded state across the 10 layers
      (GraphTrans zeroes after its GNN stack). Logits are unaffected (readout is masked) but BN running
      stats drift — cosmetic; zero padded slots per layer if you want exact parity.
- [ ] **(latent, both LorentzNet variants)** `phi_e` BatchNorm in `LorentzNetKNNBlock` normalises over
      *invalid* edges too — the edge mask is applied only *after* `phi_e`. Pre-existing, shared by both
      variants (not a Trans-vs-GPS divergence); mask before `phi_e` for cleanliness.
- [x] **"LorentzNet mean"** (scalar message aggregation was mean, should be sum) — already fixed in the
      shared block (`h_msg = m.sum(-1)`, commit `8a7b5fc`) and inherited by GraphGPS; both now match
      official LorentzNet (sum scalars / mean vectors).

## 5. Paper release — branding / identity (only the maintainer has these)

Critical (still point at the upstream LLoCa project):
- [ ] `README.md` — title ("Lorentz Local Canonicalization"), arXiv badges (2505.20280 / 2508.14898),
      author list + `heidelberg-hepml/*` links, the BibTeX block.
- [ ] `reproduce.md` — clone URL `heidelberg-hepml/lloca-experiments` + `cd lloca-experiments`,
      upstream arXiv references; **replace the manual JetClass-download line with
      `python data/collect_data.py jetclass`** (now automated).
- [ ] `REPRODUCE.md` — stale xformers claim: says running LLoCa/L-GATr taggers without xformers
      "requires modifying the data embedding and attention mask construction". No longer true —
      `model.attention_backend=flash|flex` does it as a config override (GUIDE §7, docs/OSCAR.md §2
      note). Rewrite the paragraph; upstream PR comment about it planned separately.
- [ ] `LICENSE` — copyright currently lists the upstream LLoCa authors; add your authors / mark derivative.

Minor (stale strings / metadata):
- [ ] `pyproject.toml` — add an `authors` field (name is already `gtagger-experiments`).
- [ ] add a `CITATION.cff` for the new paper.
- [ ] `experiments/base_experiment.py:262` — `path_code = os.path.join(self.cfg.base_dir, "lloca")`
      hardcodes "lloca" for the saved-source dir → project name.
- [ ] `docs/SLURM.md:79` — `#SBATCH --job-name=lloca`.
- [ ] `config/{toptagging,jctagging,ttbar}.yaml` + `config_quick/*` — debug `exp_name`s
      (`topt_local_debug`, `jc_debug`, `ttbar_debug`).
- [ ] `config/model/tag_CGENNLGATrGraphTrans.yaml` — incomplete `#should be` comment (cosmetic).
- [ ] `tests/helpers/equivariance.py:4` — upstream attribution comment; fine to keep as a credit.
- [x] **stale `tagging_features_framesnet` overrides** — the data key was renamed to
      `tagging_features`, but the old name lingered in run-command examples that would error under
      Hydra (struct mode rejects unknown-key overrides): `REPRODUCE.md` lines 227–229 & 234–235
      (×5) and `.github/workflows/experiments_tagging.yaml:39` (×1). Renamed each to
      `data.tagging_features=…` (the workflow one would otherwise have failed the tagging CI job).
- [ ] **Defork** the GitHub repo when publishing (a fork is hidden from search / awkward to Zenodo-archive);
      keep the upstream attribution in README + LICENSE.

## 6. Done (for reference)

- 2×2×2 hybrid family ({Plain, ParticleNet-ParT, CGENN-LGATr, LorentzNet-LGATr-slim} × {GraphTrans, GraphGPS}).
- Faithful LLoCa tensorial message-passing for the ParticleNet-ParT **and Plain** hybrids (MPNN/EdgeConv
  `change_local_frame` + `LLoCaAttention`), **additive** (identity frames bit-identical: 0 added params),
  jet-frame class token (GraphTrans) / invariant mean-pool (GraphGPS), rapidity clamp.
- Equivariance suite (24/24, incl. full Lorentz boost under learned `so(1,3)` frames).
- `find_lr.py` batch-size finder; `aggregate_table.py`; `data/collect_data.py jetclass`; `GUIDE.md`; `docs/SLURM.md`.
