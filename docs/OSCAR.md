# Training on Brown's Oscar cluster (CCV)

A follow-along recipe for this repo on [Oscar](https://docs.ccv.brown.edu/oscar): start at
SSH, end at a results table. Oscar-specific facts (directories, partitions, `interact`,
module workflow) follow the CCV documentation; the generic SLURM+Apptainer variant lives in
[`SLURM.md`](SLURM.md), and the science workflow (which model, which knobs, seeds, tables)
in [`GUIDE.md`](../GUIDE.md).

## 0. Connect

```bash
ssh <your-brown-username>@ssh.ccv.brown.edu     # Brown credentials (same as Canvas)
```

You land on a **login node** (`[you@login00X ~]$`). Login nodes are for file management,
editing, installs, and *submitting* jobs only — do **not** run trainings, tests, or
`find_lr.py` on them (heavy processes get killed). Compute happens through `interact`
(interactive session on a compute node) or `sbatch` (batch job).

## 1. Know the three directories (this determines where everything goes)

| dir | path | size | properties | use it for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| home | `~` | 100 GB, per-user | many-small-files optimized, snapshots | **repo clone + venv** |
| data | `~/data/<group>` | ≥256 GB, per-group | big-file reads, backed up, **permanent** | **the dataset + finished runs** |
| scratch | `~/scratch` | 512 GB soft / 12 TB hard | fast big-file I/O, **files unread for 30 days are PURGED** | **live `runs/` output** |

Check your quotas any time with `checkquota`. The CCV-recommended pattern is exactly what
we set up below: read inputs from `~/data`, write outputs to `~/scratch`, copy keepers back
to `~/data` when a run finishes (step 9). Mind the *inode* quota too (a venv is ~50k files — fine in
home, don't put it in data).

> **Scratch purge is per-file by atime** (last read). A 3-seed campaign finishes well inside
> 30 days, but if you pause mid-campaign, `find ~/scratch -atime +25` shows what's at risk —
> copy checkpoints you care about to `~/data` (step 9).

## 2. One-time setup (on the login node — this part is allowed there)

Python ≥ 3.10 and a CUDA-tuned torch both come from the **NGC PyTorch container module**:
`module load ngc-pytorch-container/25.08-py3-ayk4` sets `$NGC_PYTORCH_CONTAINER` to the
container image, and every python command in this guide runs inside it via
`apptainer exec --nv "$NGC_PYTORCH_CONTAINER" …`. Bare `python` on Oscar is the system
3.9 — never use it for this repo (too old, and no torch).

```bash
# repo + venv live in home
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/t0mnt/GTagger-experiments.git
cd GTagger-experiments

module load ngc-pytorch-container/25.08-py3-ayk4
echo "$NGC_PYTORCH_CONTAINER"        # -> the image everything below runs in

# containers auto-mount only $HOME and /tmp; bind the data/scratch trees so the
# symlinks wired up below keep working inside the container
export APPTAINER_BINDPATH="/oscar/home/$USER,/oscar/scratch/$USER,/oscar/data"

# make both permanent, for new shells and for the sbatch scripts below
echo 'module load ngc-pytorch-container/25.08-py3-ayk4' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export APPTAINER_BINDPATH="/oscar/home/$USER,/oscar/scratch/$USER,/oscar/data"' >> ~/.bashrc

# a venv that INHERITS the container's stack (torch, torch-geometric, numpy, ...),
# created from INSIDE the container; pip adds only what the image lacks.
# Filtered out of requirements.txt before installing:
#   - torch:    keep the container's CUDA-tuned build (a pip torch would clobber it)
#   - xformers: not in the image and won't build against its torch -- we run without it
#   - the lgatr/lloca [xformers-attention] extras -> plain lgatr/lloca (same reason)
apptainer exec "$NGC_PYTORCH_CONTAINER" bash -lc '
  python -m venv --system-site-packages venv
  source venv/bin/activate
  pip install --upgrade pip
  pip install -e .
  sed -E -e "/^torch[>=<]/d" -e "/^xformers/d" -e "s/\[xformers-attention\]//" \
      requirements.txt > /tmp/reqs-oscar.txt
  pip install -r /tmp/reqs-oscar.txt
'

# sanity: torch must still be the container build (an NGC "a0" version string);
# torch-geometric should now be >= 2.6
apptainer exec "$NGC_PYTORCH_CONTAINER" bash -lc '
  source venv/bin/activate
  python -c "import torch, torch_geometric, numpy; \
             print(torch.__version__, torch_geometric.__version__, numpy.__version__)"
'
```

Notes:
- **torch-geometric**: the image ships 2.3.1 but the repo needs ≥ 2.6.0 (its ptr-only
  `MeanAggregation` calls raise `NotImplementedError` on ≤ 2.5 — verified by test suite),
  so pip installs a newer one *into the venv*, shadowing the container's copy. Safe:
  PyG ≥ 2.4 is pure Python and does not pull in a new torch.
- **numpy**: the repo pins < 2.0 (weaver compatibility); if the image carries numpy 2.x,
  pip shadows it in the venv the same way. The sanity line above shows what won.
- **xformers-free is fine**, with one override to remember: all 8 hybrids and most
  baselines never touch xformers (the hybrids' L-GATr stages use dense masks → native
  torch attention, the GPS models plain torch attention, and learned frames use
  `equivectors: equimlp`, already the default; GUIDE §7). Only the four attention
  baselines whose configs pin `attention_backend: xformers` — `tag_transformer`,
  `tag_top_transformer`, `tag_lgatr`, `tag_slim` — would crash on a GPU without it.
  For those, override the backend: `model.attention_backend=flash` if the NGC image
  ships flash-attn (`apptainer exec "$NGC_PYTORCH_CONTAINER" python -c "import flash_attn"`
  — it usually does), else `=flex` (pure torch, slower, and its torch.compile path is
  version-sensitive). Either way, validate the override with one §3-style quick run
  on gpu-debug before a real job.
- The venv's `bin/python` symlinks to the *container's* python — only activate it inside
  `apptainer exec`, never in a bare login shell.

Now wire the directories per §1 — dataset into `data`, run output into `scratch`:

```bash
# dataset -> ~/data (permanent, backed up). <group> = your PI's group dir under ~/data
mkdir -p ~/data/<group>/<you>/gtagger
apptainer exec "$NGC_PYTORCH_CONTAINER" bash -lc \
  'source venv/bin/activate && python data/collect_data.py toptagging'   # ~1.5 GB download (file mgmt: login node OK)
mv data/toptagging_full.npz ~/data/<group>/<you>/gtagger/
ln -s ~/data/<group>/<you>/gtagger/toptagging_full.npz data/toptagging_full.npz

# run output -> ~/scratch (fast, purged; we copy keepers back at the end)
mkdir -p ~/scratch/gtagger_runs
ln -s ~/scratch/gtagger_runs runs
```

(The tiny `data/*_mini.npz` smoke files ship with the repo and stay in home.)

## 3. Smoke-test on a compute node

Never on the login node — grab a short interactive CPU session for the tests, then a
GPU-debug session for the model smoke:

```bash
# CPU: the invariance/equivariance suites (~6 min). No --nv on a CPU node.
interact -n 4 -m 16g -t 00:30:00
cd ~/GTagger-experiments
apptainer exec "$NGC_PYTORCH_CONTAINER" bash -lc \
  'source venv/bin/activate && pytest tests/experiments/test_tag_equivariance.py tests/experiments/test_tag_invariance.py -q'
exit

# GPU: one tiny training end-to-end (gpu-debug = short wait, short cap)
interact -q gpu-debug -g 1 -n 4 -m 20g -t 00:30:00
cd ~/GTagger-experiments
nvidia-smi                                   # confirm you see a GPU (host side)
apptainer exec --nv "$NGC_PYTORCH_CONTAINER" bash -lc '
  source venv/bin/activate
  python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available(), torch.cuda.get_device_name(0))"
  python run.py -cp config_quick -cn toptagging model=tag_LorentzNetLGATrSlimGraphGPS save=false gpus=1
'
exit
```

If `torch.cuda.is_available()` is `False` inside the container, the usual causes are a
missing `--nv` flag or not actually being on a GPU node (`nvidia-smi` on the host settles
which) — the torch build itself comes from the NGC image and is known-good.

## 4. Find batch size + LR per model (GPU interactive)

One session per model you plan to train (or chain them in one longer session):

```bash
interact -q gpu -g 1 -n 8 -m 48g -t 02:00:00     # add -f <feature> to pin a GPU type; `nodes gpu` lists them
cd ~/GTagger-experiments
apptainer exec --nv "$NGC_PYTORCH_CONTAINER" bash -lc '
  source venv/bin/activate
  python find_lr.py -cn toptagging model=tag_LorentzNetLGATrSlimGraphGPS \
      save=false +lr_find.find_batch_size=true
'
#  ->  reuse with:  training.batchsize=<N> training.lr=<lr>
```

Fill each printed pair into that model's `config/training/top_<Model>.yaml`, replacing
the two lines marked `UNSWEPT fallback` (everything else — epochs=20, AdamW,
warmup-cosine — is pinned by the shared recipe; GUIDE §5–6). Careful: an unfilled
recipe does NOT error — it silently trains at the fallback (batchsize 512, lr 1e-3).

## 5. Submit the real training

Two files: the sbatch header wraps a payload script that runs inside the container
(the `apptainer run --nv "$NGC_PYTORCH_CONTAINER" script.sh` pattern).

`train.sh` (the payload — one per model, or parametrize `$MODEL`; `chmod +x train.sh`):

```bash
#!/bin/bash
source ~/GTagger-experiments/venv/bin/activate
cd ~/GTagger-experiments

python run.py -cp config -cn toptagging \
    model=tag_LorentzNetLGATrSlimGraphGPS \
    training=top_LorentzNetLGATrSlimGraphGPS \
    data.dataset=full gpus=1
# -cp config is REQUIRED: run.py defaults to the tiny config_quick tree,
# which has no top_<Model> training recipes.
```

`train.sbatch`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -J gtagger
#SBATCH -p gpu                    # partition; `allq gpu` shows load. gpu-he needs High-End priority
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1
#SBATCH -n 8
#SBATCH --mem=48G
#SBATCH -t 24:00:00               # raise for the heavy CGENN-GPS (~a day/trial on a top GPU)
#SBATCH -o slurm-%j.out
# #SBATCH -a <account>            # only if you belong to a condo/priority account (see `condos`)
# #SBATCH -f ampere               # optionally pin a GPU architecture/feature

module load ngc-pytorch-container/25.08-py3-ayk4
export APPTAINER_BINDPATH="/oscar/home/$USER,/oscar/scratch/$USER,/oscar/data"

apptainer run --nv "$NGC_PYTORCH_CONTAINER" ~/GTagger-experiments/train.sh
```

```bash
sbatch train.sbatch
myq                       # your queue; `squeue -u $USER -t PENDING --start` estimates start time
tail -f slurm-<jobid>.out # or runs/<exp>/<run>/out_0.log once it starts
myjobinfo                 # time/memory actually used after it finishes
scancel <jobid>           # if needed
```

Each finished run prints its `table test: … \\` row into the log (GUIDE §4).

## 6. Seeds (3 trials → mean ± std)

After trial 1 finishes, submit the same run twice more as **fresh-trial warm starts**
(never plain warm starts — those reload the trained model and its finished scheduler;
GUIDE §8). In `train.sh`, replace the `python run.py` line with:

```bash
python run.py -cp ~/GTagger-experiments/runs/<exp_name>/<run_name> -cn config \
    warm_start_idx=<prev run_idx> warm_start_load=false
```

(`run_idx` is 0 for the first run, 1 after the first warm start, …; the saved `config.yaml`
in the run dir carries everything else.) The run's table row consolidates to
`[N trials] $mean ± std$` automatically.

## 7. The full campaign (which models, and which need the LR finder)

The study's grid is the 8 hybrids. **All 8 need §4** (their recipes ship with
`UNSWEPT fallback` batchsize/lr lines that must be replaced — they run without erroring
if you forget); everything else in their shared recipe is already decided:

```bash
MODELS="tag_PlainGraphTrans tag_PlainGraphGPS \
        tag_ParticleNetParTGraphTrans tag_ParticleNetParTGraphGPS \
        tag_CGENNLGATrGraphTrans tag_CGENNLGATrGraphGPS \
        tag_LorentzNetLGATrSlimGraphTrans tag_LorentzNetLGATrSlimGraphGPS"

# in a GPU interact session (§4): one sweep per model, fill each top_<Model>.yaml
for M in $MODELS; do
  apptainer exec --nv "$NGC_PYTORCH_CONTAINER" bash -lc \
    "source venv/bin/activate && python find_lr.py -cn toptagging model=$M save=false +lr_find.find_batch_size=true"
done

# then one sbatch per model (§5), then 2 more fresh-trial seeds each (§6)
```

The **baseline reference rows** (`tag_ParT`, `tag_particlenet`, `tag_lgatr`, `tag_slim`,
`tag_lorentznet`, `tag_transformer`, …) do **not** need the LR finder — they run under
their published recipes, which already pin lr/batchsize/budget:

```bash
# same train.sh/train.sbatch pattern as §5, with the payload line:
python run.py -cp config -cn toptagging model=tag_ParT training=top_ParT data.dataset=full gpus=1
# likewise: tag_lgatr+top_lgatr, tag_slim+top_slim, tag_lorentznet+top_lorentznet, ...
# xformers isn't installed (§2), so the four attention baselines need a backend override
# (flash if the image has flash-attn, else flex -- see the §2 note; validate on gpu-debug):
#   model=tag_lgatr training=top_lgatr model.attention_backend=flash
# (same for tag_slim, tag_transformer, tag_top_transformer; all other rows run as-is)
```

(Heads-up on wall time: order the queue submissions cheapest-first; `CGENNLGATrGraphGPS`
is the expensive one — budget ~a day per trial on a top GPU — while the slim models are
orders of magnitude lighter.)

## 8. The comparison table

```bash
apptainer exec "$NGC_PYTORCH_CONTAINER" bash -lc \
  'source venv/bin/activate && python aggregate_table.py --runs runs --split test --out comparison.tex'
```

## 9. Save what matters (scratch purges!)

```bash
# finished runs you want to keep -> data (permanent, backed up)
cp -r ~/scratch/gtagger_runs/<exp_name> ~/data/<group>/<you>/gtagger/runs_keep/
```

Do this at the end of the campaign (and for any long pause > ~3 weeks). `comparison.tex`,
the `table_metrics_*.json` files, `out_*.log`, and the best-model checkpoints are the
irreplaceable parts.
